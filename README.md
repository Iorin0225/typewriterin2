# README

TypeWriterin is the web-based text editor which is the best for writers who focuses to writing text.

## Motivation

""Simple, Light, and Focused.""

There are a lot of text editors and most of them have many features, that is good for programmer, blogger, newseriter, or who wants a rich editor.

However, the features can be annoying for writers because they're many motions like suggestion, auto-correct, etc... If we want to focus, we should decrease moving things in our sight.

So TypeWriterin has no move other than what you're writing. All features focus to keeping your concentration high to write text.

Inspired by OmmWriter.
